<h2>Aesymmetric and Symmetric Cryptography</h2>

    <h3>Asymmetric (or public-key) cryptography and symmetric cryptography are two different approaches to encrypting and decrypting data.</h3>
 <h4>Symmetric cryptography employs the same secret key for both encryption and decryption of data, meaning that the data is encrypted and decrypted using the same key. Some real life examples of symmetric encryption algorithms include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard (DES).</h4>
 <h4 style="color: crimson">To expand on one of the most popular and widely used symmetric encryption algorithms is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which was developed in 2001 and is widely used in many applications. AES is considered one of the most secure encryption algorithms available, making it ideal for protecting sensitive data such as financial transactions, health records, and other confidential information.</h4>
 <h5>Asymmetric cryptography is a powerful encryption method that utilizes two distinct keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is openly shared with other users, while the private key is kept secret. Any data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key, and vice versa. This unique method of encryption provides enhanced security for communication and information exchange. Asymmetric cryptography is commonly used for digital signatures, authentication, and secure key exchange. Some examples of asymmetric encryption algorithms include Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).</h5>
<h5 style="color:darkorchid">The main differences between these two types of cryptography is the way in which keys are used. In symmetric cryptography, the same key is used for encryption and decryption, which means that the key must be kept secret. In asymmetric cryptography, a public key is shared with others, which allows for secure communication without the need to share a secret key.However, using both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography can provide enhanced security for the protection of sensitive information.</h5>
